# PlatUIFileTransfer
Intend to create a source code cross platform to transfer files between any kind of  OS using a existent technology 
(rsync) with User Interface

The code is not ready, much less beautiful. This is still an outline. The intent is to create a cross-platform code 
to make life easier for users by sending, downloading, saving, updating or archiving data from any application to any. 
And on every device it works as if it were native to the operating system.
